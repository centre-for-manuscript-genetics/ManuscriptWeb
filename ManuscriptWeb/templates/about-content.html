        DanSeq, the Dance Sequence digital genetic edition project, was realised by Andrea Davidson and built by Joshua Schäuble thanks to BOF grants from the University of Antwerp. Thanks are also due to Aidan and Nancy Chambers, Vanessa Joosen and Dirk Van Hulle at the University of Antwerp, and Kris McKie and Hazel Sheeky Bird at Seven Stories, The National Centre for Children’s Books.
