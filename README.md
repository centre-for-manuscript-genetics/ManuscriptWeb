# Manuscript Web
Manuscript Web is a Virtual Research Environment developed as an open [eXist-db](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html) application for publishing documents and their transcriptions in the form of a digital scholarly edition, allowing textual scholars to expose links and relations between a literary or historical work’s different versions. 

## Development
This application is developed by [Joshua Schäuble](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/joshua-schaeuble/), a PhD student based at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/)'s [Centre for Manuscript Genetics](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/centre-for-manuscript-genetics/). Joshua is currently preparing a PhD in the field of Digital Humanities, supervised by [Dirk Van Hulle](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/dirk-vanhulle/) and [Wout Dillen](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/wout-dillen/). 

Development of Manuscript Web started in 2017 as part of the DARIAH-VL VRE-SI, an [FWO](https://www.fwo.be) funded research infrastructure that was rebranded as [CLARIAH-VL](https://clariahvl.hypotheses.org) in 2019, when the Belgian representatives of the European [ESFRI](https://www.esfri.eu) Infrastrcutures [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu) and [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu) decided to join hands. In 2019, further development of Manuscript Web was outsourced to the [CATCH 2020](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/centre-for-manuscript-genetics/projects/catch-2020/) project as part of the University of Antwerp’s co-financing plan for CLARIAH-VL. CATCH 2020 (a medium-sized FWO infrastructure for the Computer Assisted Transcription of Complex Handwriting) will use Manuscript Web as a vehicle for its HTR-enabled transcription and text recognition tools.
